# Javelin

My laptop has a large screen but small touchpad so there are two cursor movement options: slow or imprecise. This annoys me very often and affects my productivity in a negative way.

Javelin is an attempt to force cursor DWIM at least in most of cases.

It alternates cursor between two modes:

- Javelin: fast but imprecise movement to just throw cursor into the right direction
- Pointer: slow and precise movement to complete reaching the target

Some sensible timing is applied so the behavior is almost intuitive.

Depends on Sway window manager.
